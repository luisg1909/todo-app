#Task: Build a simple to-do app with React Native and Node. 

The app should have a backend connected to a database. (The choice of backend framework and database is arbitrary.)
#It should include simple authorization (session-based) and work concurrently for multiple users. There is no need 
to enter a first and last name or email. 
The app should compile and run on all three platforms (Android, web, and iOS). 
#Use TypeScript. 
#You can package your project for review in any way.
